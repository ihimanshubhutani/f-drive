# Using OAuth2.0 to Access F-Drive APIs

> **NOTE**: Use of F-Drive's implementation of OAuth 2.0 is governed by the OAuth 2.0 Policies. and limited with only **Authorization Grant type** because of more security reasons.

F-Drive APIs use the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authorization. F-Drive supports common OAuth 2.0 scenarios for client-side Authorization

To begin, obtain OAuth 2.0 client credentials from the F-Drive API Developer Console. Then your client application requests an access token from the F-Drive Authorization Server, extracts a token from the response, and sends the token to the F-Drive API that you want to access.

# Basic steps

### 1. Obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials from the F-Drive API Console.

This step is alredy mentioned on how to obtain F-Drive API credentials 

### 2. Identify access scopes

Identify requirement of scopes you want to request to F-Drive Authorization Server

Currently F-Drive supports only two scopes 

1. __file__ : To view and download files
2. __profile__ : To view user's profile information
